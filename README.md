# Number Guessing Game

A classic number guessing game I built to practice JavaScript DOM manipulation. The computer picks a random number between 1-100 and you try to guess it!

## What it does

Pretty simple - you guess numbers and the game tells you if you're too high, too low, or got it right. You get 10 tries before the game ends.

## Files

- `index.html` - the main page
- `style.css` - makes it look decent  
- `script.js` - all the game logic

## How to run it

Just download the files and open `index.html` in your browser. That's it.



## How to play

1. Enter a number between 1 and 100
2. Click submit
3. Game tells you if you're too high or too low
4. Keep guessing until you get it or run out of tries
5. Click "Play Again" to start over

## Features

- Keeps track of how many guesses you've made
- Won't let you enter invalid numbers
- Game ends after 10 wrong guesses
- Clean, simple interface


## Things I learned building this

- How to generate random numbers in JavaScript
- DOM manipulation with getElementById
- Event listeners for buttons and input
- Form validation
- CSS styling for different game states



## Browser support

Works in any modern browser. Tested in Chrome and Firefox.

## License

Feel free to use this code however you want. It's just a simple learning project.
